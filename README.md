##  Problem Statement
MetroBank wanted to better understand its customer base by answering key questions:

1. What is the total customer count and how are they distributed by **region** and **gender**?
2. How can we segment customers by **age group** (Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers) and **income bracket** (Low, Medium, High, Premium)?
3. Which customer segment (Retail, Corporate, Private) is the largest, and which has the highest average income?
4. How long have our customers been with us, and who are our most loyal customers?

## Tools & Techniques Used

This project was done entirely using **Microsoft Excel**, showcasing core analytics skills:

-  **PivotTables & PivotCharts**  
  To summarize data by customer segments, income levels, age groups, gender, and region.

-  **Calculated Columns using `IF`, `IFS`**  
  To group customers into:
  - Age Groups (Gen Z, Millennials, etc.)
  - Income Brackets (Low to Premium)

-  **Date Functions (`DATEDIF`, `TODAY`)**  
  To calculate **customer tenure**.

-  **Basic Excel Formulas**  
  - `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, etc. for computing KPIs.

##  Key Insights & Findings

 **1. Customer Base Overview**

- Total customers: 500.

- Average income: $114,399.

- Average age: 46 years.

- Average tenure: 5 years.

 **2. Distribution by Region and Gender**

-  South (143) and North (137) hold the largest customer bases.

- Gender distribution is fairly balanced across all age groups.

**3. Customer Segmentation**

- **Retail** segment dominates at 57.2% of the base.

- Boomers are the largest age group (145), followed by GenX, Millennials, and GenZ.

- Premium income bracket customers (153) are the most common, while Low income (71) is the smallest.

**4. Loyalty & Tenure**

- Average tenure is 5 years.

- A significant portion of long-term customers are in the Boomer segment, reflecting loyalty to the bank.

**5. Growth Timeline**

- Customer growth peaked in 2016, followed by steady but slower growth

**Business Impact**

- **Product Targeting**: Retail customers drive the bulk of income, but **Corporate and Private customers** could be upscaled with high-value offers.

- **Customer Retention**: Boomers remain the most loyal, but **Millennials and Gen Z** should be nurtured with digital-first solutions for future growth.

- **Regional Focus**: Expansion opportunities exist in the **East and West**, where customer bases are smaller.

- **Upselling Opportunities**: Low-income customers can be targeted with progressive savings/investment products to transition them into higher brackets.

## Final Deliverable

A set of **Excel-based reports** and dashboards that allow stakeholders to explore:

- **Customer Demographics**: Age groups, gender split, and workforce profile.

- **Segmentation**: Classification by income brackets (Low, Medium, High, Premium) and generational groups (Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers).

- **Regional Distribution & Tenure Insights**: Pivot tables and calculated columns showing where customers are located and how long they have been with the bank.

- **Income Analysis**: Average and total income comparisons across different customer groups and segments.

This project demonstrates my ability to use **Excel formulas**, **calculated columns**, **date functions**, and **PivotTables/PivotCharts** to transform raw data into **actionable business insights**. It highlights how Excel can go beyond spreadsheets to serve as a **powerful data analysis** and **storytelling tool** for strategic decision-making.
